# Project

This contains a frontend and backend. I've provided the backend which has a barebone get request and a mongodb database that you'll have to start via docker(see backend readme).

## Requirements

- Do a get request at `http://localhost:1234/lla`
- Grab that data and show it on an html page
- Include a button that triggers the convertion from lla to ecef and after that convert button is pushed display the translation

## Goals

- We want to see if you can read documentation
- We want to see how you style a page
- We want to see if you can do mathematics
- We want to see how you format the overal frontend project

## Notes

- Feel free to use any library for styling
